short: During the last term of my undergraduate education, I didn't take any classes. Instead, I sold locally grown produce to the Galesburg community. This is the last post I wrote about this experience.

Farmet shutdown shop last week. We closed the account and said our goodbyes. Each of us are going our own ways and each of us have taken away a lot more from this experience than the little cash we pulled in for preparing and delivering fresh produce on our Wednesday mornings. 

Now, I impulsively want to list the key points of what I learned from this experience, but I'll hold off and instead relay an example of how creating a small business changed the way I work.

This Sunday I had the goal of updating this website because I had learned a lot about web development since when I put it together a year ago. I spent the first hour of work going down the wrong path: I immediately took out the tools I was most comfortable with (Ruby on Rails, Heroku) and started drafting features that would be necessary to create this site using those tools (authentication, models, views, etc). I was becoming a very involved first hour and there was a voice in the back of my head that told me to get up and have a cup of tea and think it over.

One of the lessons I took away from creating a 'toy' startup was that learning *how* to do wasn't nearly as important as learning *what* to do. Learning which tasks created the most return on time investment was key. I think we spent days in front of the computer looking at secondary data on the local food movement, spinning our wheels. After a few hours of talking to nearby farmers, we gained the essential, practical knowledge that prepared us for this business.

After I had my cup of tea, I realized that what I was doing was too much of doing and not enough reflection on what the website really needed. So then I made my list!

  * Simple interface, aesthetic
  * Writing is the core focus
  * Writing should be filterable by topic

After setting these goals, the plan for development was pretty clear: use simple tools which are fast to implement. A few hours of tinkering with javascript and github pages, and the new website was created, and I had some time left over to do what was really important with the website, write. 

**Edit**: It's February 2016 now and I'm editing the structure of the website again, including changing this page from HTML to markdown. It's even simpler now.
