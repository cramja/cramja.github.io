# Top 3

- Crime and Punishment
- Master and Margarita
- Thinking Fast and Slow

Like last year, the books I enjoyed the most tended to be fiction. I attempted reading a mass market paperback version of _Crime and Punishment_ when I was in high school but lost interest and didn't really understand the plot as it was happening. I read Oliver Ready's translation and found it to be one of the most phenomenally engrossing novels I've read. I felt like I could have used a course on the history which the book was placed in and so I [found some youtube lectures][crime-lectures] that helped to fill in some of the context gaps that I sensed.

On the topic of Russian authors, I re-read Master and Margarita, a slightly more contemporary piece by Mikhail Bulgakov. It's also rich, slightly more cartoonish story of the devil coming to Moscow, playing off the prejudices of the socialist-minded Muscovites. Moreover, there's the passion story told through a humanist lens, but with the fantasy of Satan throwing a ball for the undead thrown into the mixture.

Finally, _Thinking Fast and Slow_ was a good recap of what I missed from not having taken psychology in undergrad. It could use a second or third read in places to cement the understanding of our brain mechanics. Reading this paired nicely with listening to the _Maps of Meaning_ 2017 lecture series of Jordan Peterson, a Canadian Psychology professor and clinical practitioner. Where _Thinking_ was more mechanistic, _Maps_ was more of Peterson's biased view of how one should learn to act in our modern day society. I appreciated his frankness, and learned a lot along for the ride.

# Other Influences

After graduating, I ran full speed ahead into work at a software startup and therefore didn't have a whole lot of time for pursuing reading. However, for the last 3 months I have been learning German with the app `Duolingo`. I have been  studying for at least fifteen minutes a day, and with just that I have been pretty happy with the progress. I may use this knowledge. Wir werden sehen wohin das geht. Aufwiedersehen!
