Humans were the first domesticated animals. What would it be like to watch our great<sup>32</sup> grandparents in the wild?

*edit:* As someone mentioned, a human generation is about 20 years. Therefore 32 generations is 640 years ago; it's smaller than what I was targeting (perhaps I was thinking 2<sup>32</sup> generations when I was writing this, so ~85 billion years ago, so a totally logical 18 times older than the earth...)

I did not mean to ask about life in the middle ages (though I've heard it's okay, barring plague). Really, what I meant was, "humans today live sheltered lives compared to those of yesteryear. What would it be like to interact with non-domesticated humans?"
