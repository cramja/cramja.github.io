short: I'm at home over christmas and I started to wake up at the same time I would in high school. I wonder if we're cued by our enviroment for certain things.

People have an internal clock which is responsible for their circadian rhythm. Essentially, the circadian rhythm is a chain of chemical reactions which oscillates in feedback loops. Environmental factors like feeding times and light levels can impact these cycles, however these reactions will be self sustaining even when external cues are mixed up. If you want to know more, here's a Nature <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7424/full/nature11704.html">article</a> which is behind a paywall, and <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/Biological_Chemistry/Asher/sites/Biological_Chemistry.Asher/files/adamovich_et_al._cell_metabolism_2014.pdf">one</a> which is not behind a paywall but slightly off topic (circadian/diet). If you go beyond the abstracts and introductions, you'll know more than me about the topic because this was just a lead in to a realization I had.

I'm at my parent's house on break and I've been waking up a 6 oclock sharp every morning just like I did every day of high school. Nowadays, when I'm home in Madison, my tenacity completely derails. I get up ten to seven exactly, no alarm needed. My question is what the heck, why did I suddenly revert back 40 minutes when I go back to sleeping in my parent's house?
