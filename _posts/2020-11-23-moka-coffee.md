Before this year, I was a coffee snob. Admittedly, I've spent more money than I'd like to
admit on boutique coffee beans. But while spending the holidays with my parents, I became
acquainted with their latest gadget: a coffee making device from Italy called a moka pot,
and this had the side effect of permanently shrinking my coffee budget. My relationship with
caffeine has been forever altered as this device afforded me a parsimonious alternative to
maintaining my caffeine habit. Let me explain.

I'd like to call the moka pot the "poor man's espresso machine" but that'd not be accurate
since it has no mechanical parts and therefore it probably doesn't qualify as a machine. 
It's a stove top coffee maker. Simpler than an espresso machine, its solid metal base is
placed directly on the stove and builds up steam pressure which is then forced through fine
grounds. A cartridge filled with ground coffee and shaped something like a funnel, is dropped
into the base such that the tip of the funnel is submerged in the water. The upper unit of
the pot looks like a short pitcher but with a spout extruding up through the center where 
the hot coffee steam bubbles up through before running down the sides and collecting in the
body of the pitcher. This pitcher usually has a lid since the coffee sometimes exits the
spout in a violent coffee geyser if the boiling proceeds too quickly. In summary: boiling
water in the base passes through a funnel that holds the grounds, cools in the pitcher's
spout, and collects in the pitcher. All said and done, this contraption costs about thirty
dollars, running up about ten times less expensive than the cheapest espresso machine.

As a long time coffee abuser who used a twenty dollar aeropress to extract his morning dose,
cost, is not what impressed me about the moka pot. What impressed me was its ability to turn
very much average Kirkland brand coffee grounds into slightly less crappy yet steaming-hot,
caffeine-laden drink. Yes, that's right: I can't promise gourmet results, but I have beheld
the wonders of an acceptable weekday transformation of budget coffee into perfectly
palatable brew. Here's how you too can accomplish these extremely ordinary results

1. Fill the base with water. Place on the stove at high heat

2. Optionally, begin boiling some water in a secondary pot. You'll use this to dilute the
   final product if you find moka coffee is unpalatablely strong as I do.

3. Fill the cartridge up with coffee grounds. Try to use the cheap stuff for an authentic
   taste. Also, don't pack the funnel. It works best if it's filled to the point where the
   cartridge is leveled off but not packed.

4. Add a pinch of salt to the top of the grounds. This makes the flavor marginally better.

5. When the water in the moka base is boiling, take it off the heat, and drop the
   cartridge into the base, and screw on the top of the pot. Return the assembly to the heat.

6. I leave the lid up for this final part since it's easy to control the rate of brewing
   and prevent the coffee from sputtering over your stove top if you slowly move the moka pot
   off the heat as the brewing progresses. I have a glass-top electric range so I can easily
   slide it off 50% of the way off the stove as it's finishing brewing, preventing excessive
   heat to burst the final brew from the top.
7. When it's completed brewing, pour into your mug (you can pre-heat this with the water
   from that other pot). Dilute to taste. I prefer a small amount of heavy cream in mine as
   it seems to coat the inside of my mouth with a protective layer of fat which somewhat
   diminishes the acidity of the cheap coffee.

And there you have it. In less than ten minutes, you've converted cheap coffee grounds into
a perfectly acceptable brew. Cheers.
