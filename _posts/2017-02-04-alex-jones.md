short: Comments on the Alex Jones interview with Joe Rogan. It ran my mind through a blender and now I'm pouring it back out in this post.
---

Alex Jones, alternative news personality, did an [interview with Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZPCp8SPfOM) on his podcast. It was an entertaining 4 hours where my mind was shattered a dozen times. It was like watching the History channel, but on crack. Plenty of bizarre 'facts'. Let me recap some of the ones that stuck with me, see if you agree.

* There's a breeding program that produced some of the smartest families in England. This was back in the mid 1850's during the scientific revolution.

* Darwin was in to some kind of sorcery that involved channeling other dimensions. He used this to get some of his break-through ideas. DNA and genetic science was similarly predicted.

* Weather is being controlled by the HAARP project. The USA can control hurricanes. This technology is not new: we could create typhoons during the Vietnam war. Also, global warming is not real in the sense that greenhouse gases via fossil fuels are causing it, but because of a larger solar phenomenon. The green house gas theory is being used by global elites to create a carbon tax.

* There have been plenty of manned moon landings by several countries. The moon is full of water. An Indian probe will discover this water sometime in the next year. 

* There is a global arms race to create a super-ai. Google is leading the pack and will create an ai that absorbs and transcends human consciousness. Humans are merely a vehicle being used to create the machine.

* NASA is 90% secretive and uses technology which is beyond our imaginative capabilities.

* There is a child abuse ring in Washington. Many top politicians are involved. This information can be used to blackmail them. Trump is trying his best to expose them. Related "Pizza-gate" scandal was created by the mainstream media in double-blind. There really is a child-abuse ring at a high level of government, but the mainstream media wanted to make the thought of it look ridiculous by focusing on a small off-shoot story.

* Hilary Clinton tried to hack the election. The voting machines are compromised by the democratic party. They switched votes in 5 states.

* Trump is an anti-globalist looking out for the best interest of the common person. Other (positive) anti-globalist movements include Brexit, and the French anti-globalist movement led by La Pen. Also, Trump talks to Alex Jones on a frequent basis. 

* The elite has set up a plan to enslave people via taxes. Taxes are the life-blood of the global elite. Trump wants to remove income tax for the lowest tax bracket. 

* There's a break away civilization of super-rich people that want to colonize the moon.

* Nazis are in alliance with George Soros who is a globalist vampire who is also the head of a global elite that wants to enslave the common man.

I may have gotten that last one wrong- I cannot remember the relationship between George Soros and Nazis which Alex Jones pointed out, but I think there was one. 

# Interpretation

There is a part of everyone that would like to believe the world is more fantastical, stranger, more twisted, more manipulated than it really is. I think that the sense of wonder that we get from hearing conspiracies is the real value of conspiracy theories. 

I would like to live in a universe where aliens are in communication with higher ups and they're planning on how they can make earth into a global utopia but the dark forces of globalist Neo-Nazis are sabotaging their efforts. It would make life much more interesting. It would make real suffering less emphatically hurtful.

People are bored. We have routine. We have long spaces in our life which we feel the need to occupy our minds with audio entertainment. That's why we're listening to the podcast in the first place. A promise of a fantasy universe full of conspiracies is attractive in the same way that the catholic vision of a bright cloudy heaven-full-of-angels can be: it simplifies and glorifies something which is incomprehensible to mere mortals. Just like I cannot know what is after death while I am alive, I cannot understand what HAARP really is when I am but a normal civilian with no physics background.

Also, Alex Jones has a way of molding conversation in such a way that always seems to promise more while distracting you from the present facts (or lack thereof). It's very simple. Make an absurd claim, then use anecdotal evidence to back it up. Once people start picking at your evidence, talk loudly and proclaim that you're about to drop another truth bomb.

It's actually a pretty effective technique on me. I'll admit, I once watched an hour long [conservative-scare tactic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjVv54mFlQA) put out by the think-tank "Agora". The narrator uses these familiar techniques to promise you 'just one more revelation' before trying to sell you his book with 'all the answers'. Google around for Agora's founder, Bill Bonner, and you'll find that fear mongering is a pretty easy way to make quick cash.

## What can we believe? 

I think we have to take some of the conspiracies off the list and examine them one by one. Let's take the Darwin example. According to Alex Jones, Darwin and other great scientists of the era were bred in a eugenics program created by the British government. Also, Darwin used channeling to get some of his ideas. 

If Darwin was part of a eugenics program to create a super-intelligent scientist class, then why did he marry his cousin? It was colloquially understood that marrying your family members would produce weak offspring. In fact, Darwin speculated that there was some kind of depressive effect that occurs when close relatives produce offspring. This was after witnessing the death of many of his children. I remembered some of this from Bill Bryson's *A Short History* but also went on Wikipedia to confirm. (Not that Wikipedia should be the end-all, but this is a blog).

As for Darwin and conjuring, I know nothing about this. In my own experience, learning things has meant intense thinking, and periods of relaxation, but never conjuring knowledge from another dimension. Furthermore, Darwin was a sickly man once he returned to England. He may have caught a tropical disease which left him weak, and wanting to avoid visitors. If he had mastered conjuring, I wonder if he could not have also healed himself? Still, I will keep the possibility of Darwin and the occult in mind if I read more about Darwin. In the mean time, it's nothing that I will attribute to him as fact.

Let's take another example: water on the moon. If you go to the Wikipedia page about lunar water, you can see that it is mainstream knowledge that there's likely a lot of water at the lunar poles and possibly more water below the surface. Any water on the surface which could be exposed to sunlight would have been lost because there's no atmosphere keeping the water vapor bound to the moon. As for Alex Jone's claim about India launching a probe which will find massive evidence of lunar water below the crust in a year's time: we shall see. 

The moon example is interesting because it is used as conspiracy-theory scaffolding. If there is water on the moon, then we can support a global elite moon-colony. 1+1 = 1e6. This is out of scale is what I'm saying. 

I would say there are technological hurdles to colonizing the moon. A conspiracy theorist would say that the government is hiding technology from us. 

Nice try Marc.

Hmm, I would take a look at the US budget and compare how much is being spent on defense versus space travel. Hint: NASA funding is nothing compared to our defense budget. Probably, we wouldn't be able to fund a super-space program... unless the real budget is being hidden from us. Or the defense budget is really being used to fund space weapons. I wonder if Alex Jones would confirm this. My point is, a good conspiracy theorist would have a story woven for anything. 

I like conspiracy theories, and though I don't think I will spend my life reading about them, I will keep them in mind when I read about the topics covered. (It would be great to find a book on conspiracy theories which actually went from being theories to later revealed as true.) The Kennedy assassination probably was a conspiracy. I think there is corruption in government. Unlike Jones, I don't think Trump is some kind of panacea: that is a simplified version of reality. Like Jones, I think AI is the next frontier of technology, but that Google was created for that purpose, no. I think that climate change is real, and that humans are responsible. I think we as a society lies on the brink of extinction from events outside our control: [volcanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_Caldera), [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event), and [virology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic) to name a few.

# Take away

Keep an open mind, but run it through a filter by reading credible sources.
