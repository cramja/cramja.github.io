short: I had a deep and resounding realization today.

I'm learning the classical guitar and while I'm practicing I have the tendency to suck in my cheeks. There's no good reason for this right?

Right- I googled it and there isn't a large community of musical cheek suckers.

What I realized was that I used to play saxophone and that maybe this is some unconscious tick that I learned while blowing into the horn. If that's true, then that's really cool the brain would make that association.
