Given that I'm making some major life changes, I'd like to share a reflection on  Robert Frost's [poem](poem-source), *The Road Not Taken*. It helped me understand my decision.

___



The basic idea of the poem is that the narrator is presented with a binary choice of paths to follow while he is walking through the woods.

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood

The obvious metaphor is to the conscious choices we make in our lives. 

We are sometimes aware that we must make a major life decision, like college, marriage, jobs, etc. We can ponder these decisions before acting, but our predictive powers are limited to seeing only a short ways into the future.

> ...long I stood <br>
> And looked down one as far as I could

The narrator pauses at the fork in the road, and strains his eyes to see which of the roads will be the better choice. There is some calculated thought in how he initially approaches the problem.

This changes when he makes the decision, as the middle two verses reveal the arbitrariness in his decision.

He first justifies his choice of the second road by saying that it was grassy, therefore less packed down by traveler's feet. He then chooses this road on the basis that it is less traveled.

> Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

But, and this is important, he immediately reduces his rationale: 

> Though as for that the passing there <br>
> Had worn them really about the same,

In other words, **both the roads are equal.** Both choices are indistinguishable, at least from the perspective of someone who has not traveled them both.

Going back to our metaphor, I don't think it would be far off to say that this is a statement about individual experience. As in, I may have a very similar life path as my neighbor, but because I will experience through an individual and un-learned mind, it is exciting, and uncharted territory unfolding before me.

To make it even clearer that both roads looked the same at the start, Frost reiterates 

> And both that morning equally lay <br>
> In leaves no step had trodden black.

E.g. college A looks as good as college B; job A looks about as good as job B.

Though arbitrary, our choices are irrevocable. Frost recognizes that we only get to make a decision once.

> Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.

Permanence can sit uneasy in people's minds. Nobody wants to be stuck with the consequences of the wrong choice. So the narrator can justify his choice by telling himself that he will come back, but in the same pattern as before, he reverses the argument as soon as he makes it. And this is where the metaphor is really explicit. If you're hiking a real-life dirt-and-roots trail, usually you can walk back. If not that same day, then you can plan another trip to do it again. But in life, the movement of time removes the option of a second chance.

And at the mention of time, the narrator closes, foreseeing that he will one day look back on that decision.

> I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:

He concludes on what is often misinterpreted as a sort of aphoristic line about making the unpopular choice in hopes of future fulfillment:

> Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.

These lines are actually ironic.

When the narrator was going on his journey, he recognized that the choice of roads was arbitrary. But now, at the end of his life, "somewhere ages and ages hence," he ascribes his success to his choice of roads.

I suspect the narrator is being humorous here. He's predicting that he will be giving this advice, *with a sigh*: nonchalantly, possibly some snobbish disinterest, "you know I made this really hard choice, and look, it made me such a more accomplished and unique individual,"

By making this prediction, I think he is really having some humility. He recognizes this is a common human behavior. We ascribe personal volition to what is actually randomness. He's saying, I made my choice confidently, I can't know where it goes, but if it turns out all right then I will surely remember it as *the* choice.

So, when making a life choice, just say screw it. It'll work out.

This also made me wonder if his choice was really a binary one- about why he couldn't have gotten off the road and gone through the woods, or gone backwards. I have some ideas, but maybe I will keep it for another day.
