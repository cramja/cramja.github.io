short: On a first pass of Crime and Punishment, I thought Dostoevsky was trying to make a claim that older women had a tendency to go insane.
---

When reading *Crime and Punishment*, I initially thought that Dostoevsky was trying to make a point about crazy old women in his portrayal of the demise of the two older women of the novel, Raskolnikov's mother, Pulkheria, and the aristocrat-fallen-to-pauper Katernia Ivanova. On further consideration, I have come to understand that it's probably not the case that Dostoevsky thought older women have a tendancy to go crazy, but really that for these two women, their denial caused them to go insane.

Katerina is the worst off, going through her tirade of consumption and denial. Beating her frightened children, telling passerbys that this was the behavior of nobility, all the while coughing up blood and spitting out the broken songs of her aristocratic youth which she clings to in her poverty.

In a more subdued but similar manner, Pulkheria dies of her own sickness of denial. She suffers fits of insanity at her level of and grade of execution- involving Dunya in a day of preparing the house for the return of her beloved son who desperately needs to be the figure of success and lightness in her world.

What I'm trying to understand is the pattern here. There's a strong pattern of denial running through the book. Raskolnikov's internal schism is based partly on his denial of his conscience. His ability to both understand his hesitance, and his guilt, causes him to wrestle with his pride: he cannot deny that his beautiful intellectual theories are not congruent with his behaviors. 

So too do the two women posses this *denial*. However, unlike Raskolnikov, it's not for the purpose of defending a theory born of vanity. But, I have to imagine that the stakes are about the same. 

Consider our hero's stakes. If he confronts his denial, then he must face the punishment which his theory should protect him but that his conscience subjects him to even prior to the murder. He must accept the consequence of his actions, which is, that on the level of society he must do penance in prison. And, in the eyes of his guilty conscious (the one which thinks himself no more than a louse), he does already suffer. And this suffering leads him to only two options: suicide, or Siberia. To die for his theory, or to admit his arrogance. That's a great bargain! But, it's the stakes he's playing with for coming out of denial and speaking his confession.

The women on the other hand, well, take Katerina. Her denial is of her social status. Apparently the most important thing to her is that she can tell people she went to a distinguished school and was all set up for the good life with some rich husband, and all the fancy trappings thereof. Her denial is that her current pauperism is temporary, that she will come on some money, regain her status, and then open a school for distinguished girls. Spinning these fantasies only takes her to worse and worse places as her health deteriorates from consumption. In the final scene, she's all but lost it: a public embarrassment and laughing stock of drunkards, all to the terror of her children. 

The stakes? Well, we don't get to peer into her head as Dostoevsky let's us for Raskolnikov, and that's maybe something we should be thankful. Katerina's mind is permanently busted up from her disease. And maybe that's just it: there was no escaping her fantasies in the end. That ship had sailed. And, it's no bloody wonder, her options are: admit that you're married to a drunk, admit that he's your last shot at a husband, admit that he's not stopping his drinking any time soon, admit that your daughter the prostitute is the only reason you're not out on the street. Her stakes are the painful acceptance of those hopeless, and foreseeablely permanent realities. The one glimmer of hope that perhaps had some promise was when Marmeladov got some temporary employment. But she botched this up too, at least with some possible contribution of fault. She didn't have to belittle Marmeladov and treat his in such an overly expectant manner.

But the stakes, the stakes, the stakes. What did it matter? The best I can do is, her stakes are admitting that there's no hope. She doesn't have the eternal salvation and trust in Jesus Christ as does her saintly prostitute daughter Sonya. All she has is the salvation of the status of gentry here on earth. And that, as anyone can read, isn't happening.

So, Pulkheria, Raskolnikov's mother, what about her stakes? Well, first off her denial was and always had been that Raskolnikov was A-OKAY. That his bouts of damn near obvious insanity and illness were nothing more than a strain of thinking that are forge the brightest ideas- the kinds that make it into fancy literary journals, the kind that indicate is imminent success. Despite his surroundings being caked in dust a half inch thick, in an inhospitable hole of a room in a decrepit boarding house, he's surely the point of literary breakthrough. Evidence of this is enhanced by the fact that he sold all of his books for food.

This is strange for a woman like Pulkheria because she's evidently bright. She writes a polished letter to Raskolnikov in the first book, describing her impression of Dunya's fianc√©e, the arrogant, and crudely objective Luzhin. This letter does hint at her repression of her true feelings about the marriage, and that's importantly not full on denial. At least, Raskolnikov has no trouble picking out Pulkheria's the dampened misgivings. So I wouldn't say that she out and out a denier with Dunya the same way that she was with Raskolnikov. 

I imagine Pulkheria's stakes are a little different with Raskolnikov. First, her reason for traveling to St. Petersburg on their last dime was partly out of the expectant joy of being able to see their long-apart son. Second, their status is precarious: they're poor, Dunya was already seeking to marry for the money and with that having fallen through, their next best bet is Raskolnikov's success. So, maybe it's just about survival at that point. For Dunya, she's still too proud to have the issue of survival take precedence over he honor, but Pulkheria has the mother's vigilance, and besides, all she's really got left in the world are Raskolnikov and Dunya. She has to promise one herself one of their successes and Dunya's fell through. 

So, to summarize, Pulkheria's stakes are that to understand her son the murderer, is to trash the family name. I mean, who wants to give birth to a murderer? Not exactly the retirement she wants to enter into. That said, I'm surprised that for all of Dunya's honor, she never forces Pulkheria to confront her demons. It seems inconsistent with her character, albeit consistent with the message that self-denial is a surefire way to your demise. Additionally, Pulkheria's death is yet another leaver prying Rasknikov's theory apart.

A summary: 

Katerina Ivanovna never confesses. Her end in the sickness of her denial is pitiable, and somewhat of a foreshadowing of the end of the other older woman in the novel, Pulkheria. Pulkheria's downfall is somewhat worse. That, she's almost on the cusp of giving in to her repressed suspicions but animates them in bouts of insanity and eventually wears herself out. 

The only possible positive consequence of Pulkheria's death is that it further weakens Raskolnikov's mental defenses. Her death, among many other events such as his confession, his sickness, and his dreams; they all bring him to a place where his prideful mind can be so thoroughly broken that the simple love of Sonya can cause him to throw his head to her feet and allow his heart to open.
