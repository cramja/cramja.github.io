# Top 3

* One Hundred Years of Solitude
* The Remains of the Day
* Zorba the Greek

*One Hundred Years* is the best book I have read. It emanated warmth. The beauty of the poetic style is enchanting. It evoked profound emotion. Overall, I think Márquez is a genius. The reason that this book struck a chord with me was that I have many siblings and a large extended family. I could see some of the relationships, and continuities which the book expressed. Above all, it's a masterpiece.

*Remains of the Day* is a stark contrast to *One Hundred Years*. Instead of the evocative imaginary wanderings of Márquez, Ishiguro is a sparse writer; however, no less resounding. This book is a deeply introverted study of the hero who is a master of self deception.

*Zorba the Greek* is an oddity but perhaps a necessary read for someone who needs to better understanding of spontaneity. A good salve after reading *Remains*. A book worm like myself might be benefited from some of the antics and reveries of like those which Zorba shared with the hero.

It's interesting that my favorite books were fiction, even though the majority of books I read are non-fiction.

# Topics

## Farming/Food Systems

* Folks, This Ain’t Normal
* Everything I Want to Do Is Illegal
* Our Only World
* You Can Farm

*Ain't Normal* is about our society's distorted sense of common sense. It's incredibly illuminating and if I were to suggest one book by Joel Salatin, this would be it. A runner up is *Everything I Want to Do Is Illegal*. It speaks to the same point, but its information is valuable to anyone who buys food.

## Money

* A Random Walk Down Wall Street
* Rich Dad, Poor Dad
* Rich Dad’s Guide to Investing
* The Richest Man in Babylon

After my debit card got stolen, I started reading about the topic of money. *Random Walk* is the best book I've found so far in this area. It's shrewd, has some great stories, gives technical background, and practical advise for investing. *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* made me think about my standing as an employee in Kiyosaki's Employee/Self-employed/Business-owner/Investor quadrant. I'd recommend *Random Walk* over any of these.

## Philosophy

* Letters from a Stoic
* Open to Desire
* Going on Being

*Letters* is fantastic. Seneca is an interesting character because he's in declining health at the end of his life and at the same time, Nero has recently kicked him out of his influential position in government. As you read, this background explains his interest in Stoic philosophy. 
The other two books are because of an interest I have in meditation. I skimmed them.

## Science

* Black Swan
* Godel, Escher, Bach
* A Short History of Nearly Everything
* The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind

Read Nissam Taleb. Also, if you like science, especially its (fascinating) history, read *A Short History*. *Godel, Escher, Bach* is a difficult read, probably the most difficult book I read this year. I think it's a good read for computer scientist because it plays with mathematical rigor in a fun, and childish way.

## Self Improvement

* 10% Happier
* The Bulletproof Diet
* Body By Science

I enjoyed *10%* because Dan Harris is a former ABC news correspondent on the subject of religion, and accordingly the book is full of interesting stories about his journey on network television. It helped me better understand popular understanding of religion. 

I drank bulletproof coffee through the better part of 3 months during the winter- it's good. However, Asprey views food as a fuel for some kind of high power, deal-making, super-CEO-man and not as a holistic human experience. I think there's better books on healthy eating than *Bulletproof*. I'd suggest *Food Rules* by Michael Pollan. It's for people with normal relationships to food.

## Others 

* Lies My Teacher Told Me
* The Agony and the Ecstasy
* Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track
* How to Write a Thesis
* Jesus’ Son

*Lies* is a book every American who went through the traditional public school system should read. It's not so much subversive as it is exposing of the subversive nature of system that's currently in place. It reminded me of the David Foster Wallace commencement speech where he tells the story of fish who are unaware that they are swimming in water. Its so fundamental that it's invisible. This is a little how I felt after reading *Lies*.

# Summary

That's it for this year. I'm looking forward to reading Richard Dawkins, Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris, and many others. Hopefully I'll be able to find some good fiction in there as well.

I'll keep the updated reading list [here](/reading).
