Hello!

My name is Marc Spehlmann. I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I use this site to write about whatever I want. It's a blog.

Here's a couple of links where you can do things:

*  See what I'm [reading](/reading/).
*  Watch something [satisfying](http://i.imgur.com/AqLvXJh.gifv).
