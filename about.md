I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I specialize in databases, running with poor form, and random facts about health foods. I use this site to write about whatever I want. It's a blog.

Here's a couple of links where you can do things:

*  Watch something [satisfying](http://i.imgur.com/AqLvXJh.gifv).
*  Shoot me an [email](mailto:marc.spehlmann@gmail.com).
*  Hang my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf) on your refrigerator.
*  Stalk my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marc-spehlmann/8b/25/a6/).
*  Find this very site on my [git](https://github.com/cramja).

I also keep a [reading list](/reading/).
