Hello, my name is [Marc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-spehlmann-0a60258b/) and you can find me on [github](https://github.com/cramja) though I mostly commit on work accounts so my activity is pretty sparse. I am a software developer with experience in the following areas
* kubernetes management, development, deployment, troubleshooting, yadda yadda
* on-prem and cloud deployment, management
* tinkering in web, databases


I last updated the site on {{ site.time | date_to_long_string: "ordinal", "US"}}.
