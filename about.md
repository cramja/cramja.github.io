Hello!

My name is Marc Spehlmann. I use this site to write about whatever I want. It's a blog.

Here's a couple of links.

*  See what I'm [reading](/reading).
*  Watch something [satisfying](http://i.imgur.com/AqLvXJh.gifv). Or something [equally as satisfying](https://gfycat.com/thatalivedogwoodclubgall).
*  Shoot me an [email](mailto:marc.spehlmann@gmail.com).
*  Find this very site on my [github page](https://github.com/cramja).
*  See my professional profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/marc-spehlmann/8b/25/a6/).
*  Play with [gravity]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-12-31-gravity %})
*  Play with [squares]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-31-squares %})

By the way, people have asked in the past: why Cramja, why Golbja?

When I joined github in 2013, someone had already taken _marc_ so I reversed my name and added _ja_ because I needed a suffix that made the name unique. Thus the pattern of `name.reverse() + "ja"` was born.

I last updated the site on {{ site.time | date_to_long_string: "ordinal", "US"}}.
