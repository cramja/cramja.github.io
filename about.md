Hello, my name is Marc Spehlmann. 

I use this site to write about technology and anything else I find interesting. 
I broadly categorize my technology interests as _tech_ and everything else as
_writing_.

I work as a software engineer on security for an automotive cloud platform. In
the past, I've programmed components of relation database systems, and long
before that, worked on high performance computing simulations.

I have many hobbies consuming my free time. In the past, I've run ultra-marathons, and 
ridden just about every mountain biking trail on the penninsula. Now I choose less 
energy-intensive hobbies. As of late, I've been [learning how to learn]({% post_url 2020-11-09-learn-js %}).

Here's a couple of links.

*  Play with [gravity]({% post_url 2016-12-31-gravity %}) or [squares]({% post_url 2018-12-31-squares %})
*  Watch something [satisfying](http://i.imgur.com/AqLvXJh.gifv). Or something [equally as satisfying](https://gfycat.com/thatalivedogwoodclubgall).
*  Find this site on my [github pages](https://github.com/cramja).
*  Shoot me an [email](mailto:marc.spehlmann@gmail.com).

I last updated the site on {{ site.time | date_to_long_string: "ordinal", "US"}}.
