<div class="reading">
  Interesting theory about how events in human history have been radically altered not by many slow, predicable changes but several large ones, and how humans are bad at understanding it. Also goes into our unconscious biases in seeing the past. Great read. 

  One of the examples Taleb gives which I liked was a question: which has a higher likelihood of happening in the next few years? First, a large flood which kills thousands of people somewhere in the United States, or, second, an earthquake in California causing flooding killing thousands of people? You'll notice Taleb is clever and also a pessimist (in his words, a realist-skeptic).
    
  I really enjoyed about Taleb's writing style was that he kept several fictional characters alive and running throughout the book. It's a nonfiction work and its essentially about statistics, so prone the dullness. His fictional cast is well imaginatively played.

**The Remains of the Day** - Kazuo Ishiguro
<div class="reading">
  Loved this book. It's the story on an English butler approaching the end of his career, reflecting on the fulfillment he had been chasing in life and, for seemingly the first time, the consequences of his pursuit.

  The first chapter actually threw me off. I thought the narrative had a synthetic voice, and that it was too forced. Approaching the book again the next night, I fell into Ishiguro's trap. He takes you inside the the head of Stevens, an aging butler whose life has revolved around the his career and maintaining dignity and professionalism. The magic of this work is the strength of Steven's inner dialog. For instance, at one point Stevens is reflecting on a particularly painful experience he shared with his coworker and heartbreak, Miss Kenton, and right when you think he'll come straight out with his true feelings, he reels back into several pages of commentary on how to polish silver. Ishiguro, apparently, has familiarity enough with repression to come up with brilliant passages like that.

  I felt this book might better be viewed as a comedy instead of a tragedy. Steven's father is also a butler and, in his years leading up to his death, works at the estate with Stevens. He comes down with a fever and is dying on a night which also happens to be a large gathering of bureaucrats at the estate, meaning that Stevens is split between two responsibilities. To Stevens, it is intolerable to leave his post as butler to the party even as his father breathes his last. In their hasty parting words to each other, his father expresses deep regret. Stevens blindly ignores the meaning, making every attempt to hasten the conversation to a close and return downstairs so that he may maintain a high level of service for the party guests. The absurdity of the situation makes it comical. Stevens actually believes he is doing the correct thing and thinks that his robot-like behavior is behavior which his father approves. As Steven reflects on the situation and his relation to his father, we see regret, but actually not until later into the story.

**The Agony and the Ecstasy** - Irving Stone
<div class="reading">
  Biographical fiction about the artistry of Michelangelo. Did you know that programmers are modern-day Michelangelos? 

  I read this in short segments over the course of my first semester of graduate school and consequently related myself as a struggling computer science student to the great artist. Not knowing anything about Michelangelo (apart from being a ninja turtle), this book was a surprisingly good introduction to art history as it was a fun work of fiction. 


  I drew strength from the description of Michelangelo being a hard worker and stubborn in his ideas. Basically, we learn that Michelangelo has this incredible dawn-to-dusk drive and a crazed passion for his work. One of the best examples of his expertise was the comparison the author made between Michelangelo's [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(Michelangelo)#/media/File:Michelangelo%27s_David_2015.jpg) and Bandinelli's [Hercules](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/statue-hercules-cacus-florence-5674050.jpg). The stiff, over-musculatured posture of Hercules is an imitation of David's natural gait, and measured body. Michelangelo clearly understood his craft.

### More to Come.

This is a continual process. Typically, I read on weekday nights for 30 minutes to an hour before going to sleep, so I get through a few books a month. Also, if you know a good book, I take [recommendations](mailto:spehlmann@cs.wisc.edu).
