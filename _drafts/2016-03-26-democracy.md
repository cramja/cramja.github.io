**In light of new technologies, it's time that we rethink the mechanism of our democracy.**

### Overview

Our presidential race is political entertainment, not a well studied, cultured debate. To see how far it's become, ask yourself, do you want a president who will call someone a 'fat-pig' on stage during his campaign? If the idea of president is partly that he or she will somehow be a physical representation of the United States, then we have to ask ourselves if we want America's vocabulary to be slung from the gutter. 

After examining our current political environment, we can ask if there is a better way. I propose that our democracy can adapt to the changing technological enviroment to provide more transparency and involvement in our government, while retaining most of the current political system.

That's why I'm voting for Amazon Mechanical Turk as president. 

### Lazy Democracy

As I write, we have another six months before we cast our final ballots. We have another six months of bickering, 'revelations', debates, and inevitably heated political conversations. In an era where information is both free and instant, I doubt that a year of media circus can produce more useful information about a candidate than can a few weeks of live-streamed internet debate, interviews, and level headed speeches. Inevitably, a year of debates will reduce down to a few key points in the American voter's mind. 

A quick biology lesson: humans are 'information economizers'. This means we use a small amount of information to make a decision. In other words, we're lazy. We take a few, seemingly important facts and rely on them for the bulk of our decision-making. In presidential elections, this means we will look at a candidate and size them up first as a flesh-and-blood human being. Factors like height, facial symmetry, good hair, perceived toughness probably have more weight in our minds than do abstract ideas like foreign policy (this is a field known as [evolutionary psychology][GAAD-TRUDEAU]). As human creatures, the successful propagation of our DNA through the generations depends on our ability to quickly size up a mate. Our human-evaluation machinery was not evolved to choose the best person for dealing with international crises, but the strongest, most disease resistant mate. In one sense, we should not need over a year to size up our candidates, but a few seconds.

In relation to this, political conversation revolves around topics more suited to a soap-opera rather than topics related to the governing of the most influential nation in the world. My own ears have processed a lot of "he said this, she did that" sort of chatter, and very little talk of how candidates would respond to environmental calamities, domestic terrorism, policy on moving troops to Afghanistan- the heavy stuff. Again, I think this is human nature. It's much easier to talk about a candidate's potty mouth as it is to have a conversation about the implications of sea levels rising 100 meters in the next fifty years. We'll end up in hell because democracy means appealing to the most basic of human desires.

It's easy to talk about the bickering and jabs because reality is heavy. In case you haven't heard, there's a painkiller epidemic in the United States. Our war in the middle east helped destabilize Syria leading to the current refugee crisis. Global CO2 levels passed 400ppm and the environmental effects are on a 40-year lag period, meaning that the global warming we're seeing now is a relic of the 70's. Folks, when you flip over a few stones and start looking at it closer, you'll find that it's a mad world out there. Hard topics don't make good soap opera conversation.

Remember that we, ape-evolved human beings, are lazy, associative machines. If candidate brings up an important issue, but an issue with negative implications, the human mind will associate that candidate with those negative feelings derived from the issue. For example, if I have fear and uncertainty about the future of this planet in relation to global warming, then a candidate who speaks about global warming becomes in my mind associated with the fear of global warming. Will I vote for a candidate who evokes a faint feeling of dread? My guess is probably not, especially if the other candidate's campaign is centered on the word "Hope". To be a realist is political suicide.

We can spend an entire year debating without focusing in on consequential issues. We can chat endlessly about candidate's personal lives, their handling of emails, and their verbal slip-ups without ever bringing the issues which are more likely to affect our lives. We should leave this madness where it can be innocently enjoyed: Netflix. 

### Refactoring the Presidency

Personally, I like the soap opera for the conversation it produces but fear the consequences of putting the weight of our nation's executive power on it. Let's make our president the equivalent of the Queen of England. The Queen represents the historical political traditions and cultural values of England. Let's put Arnold Schwarzenegger up for president. Who cares if he was born in Austria, he'd probably make better speeches than Hillary. 

### Democracy for people who use Uber


For those who have never used Mechanical Turk, it is Amazon's propriety crowd-sourcing platform. The exact purpose of Mechanical Turk isn't what I'm going to suggest we apply to democracy, but the idea of crowd sourcing decision-making tasks is applicable. I am humorously suggesting Mechanical Turk as president because it's the only anthropomorphic crowd sourcing platform of which I am aware.

The mechanics of President Mechanical Turk's (MT we'll call it) political system are simple. They can be summarized in the words 'transparency' and 'democracy'.

Every week on Monday night, the major bills of the week are put online. Every American has the right to log on and cast a ballot, yay or neigh, for the bills. The polls close Tuesday at midnight and the numbers are compiled and made publicly available. Everyone could research how each county, each state, each region voted. 

It is now congress's responsibility to look at their state's votes and make their decision based on the collective vote of their state. This part of the political process would remain unchanged (excepting the expediency). Congress gets 48 hours to make a decision. After they cast their votes, their voting information is put online alongside the popular vote so we the people can see how their vote compared to the popular vote.

As it is now, the president has veto power. If a controversial bill passes congress, it is we the people who have veto power. MT puts each bill into a veto-able state for 24 hours. If the majority of voting Americans choose to veto the bill, it is vetoed, otherwise, we have a new law.

### Implications

I know this is crazy, starry-eyed, techno-liberal talk but hey, see my point: responsibility of our government should be in the hands of 'we the people'. President MT would end the need for a political soap opera of issues which are not the true bread-and-butter issues of democracy but rather a media circus. To some degree it diminishes our human reliance on decision economizing metrics and might allow us to do a little research on the issues being filed through congress. It places responsibility of our democracy in the hands of 'we the people' not just once every four years, but once a week.

Vote for the only president who will truely respect your vote. Vote for the only president whose voice will ring with the collective intelligence of the United States. Vote for Mechanical Turk, because when you do, you are committing responsibility to your government. You are taking responsibility for your future as an American.

<!-- America has a unique political history in that we essentially started with a blank slate. We got to draft up a constitution where little was based on aristocratic traditions. We drafted it from a motive of creating the best government for the people, not for a few people*. We drafted it to meet the demands of the time. This was a time when communication from one part of the colony to another could take months. We designed our political system for that era.

Even in my short experience as a programmer, I see how software written for one era makes assumptions about that particular hardware environment. As hardware changes, what was an efficient algorithm may now be slow. In large systems, like an operating system, you can re-write certain components. Like, if you use a solid state drive, you're file system has probably been partly re-written to respond to the fact that optimizing for sequential access is unnecessary in a new world where random access is just as fast. 

Was the system of government written for a bygone era and can we adapt to the new hardware landscape?

Folks, this is why I am voting for Amazon Mechanical Turk as president of the United States. -->
