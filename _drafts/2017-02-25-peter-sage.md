short: Sometimes I listen to positive speakers to prime my thoughts. Peter Sage, a motivational speaker, has a positive vibe. He's now serving an 18 month term in prison.

I'm reading about [psychological priming][priming]. Priming says that you can unconsciously influence someones behavior by feeding your target certain mental cues. You can make students walk slower by using words associated with the elderly. You can make people more individualistic by having them think about money. You can make black students score worse on standardized tests by reminding them of their race. And this list goes on, but I hope you see that there is potential for positive as well as negative cuing.

I decided that it'd be a good idea to prime myself with something positive each morning. This usually means writing, or reading passages from a book. Recently I incorporated videos on YouTube. I try to find short clips which are positive, or by someone famous who I admire. In particular, I watched a few featuring Peter Sage, a self-proclaimed serial-entrepreneur and [motivational speaker][sage-site]. I was attracted to his convincing positivity. I wanted to emulate his enthusiasm. 

Sage is a great speaker. I found this in his [court proceedings][court-proceedings], Judge Jays writes, 

> He has an extremely high level of self-belief, matched by immense aspirations for future personal success

This confidence makes for a great speaker.

Given that Peter Sage is now in prison, I felt uncertain about my own judgment. Am I an easy mark? Here's a little expos√© on Peter Sage from the perspective of someone who listened raptly to his podcast interviews and wants to recover from feeling like a fool.

## The Positives

On a long drive, I listened to an interview between him and [Dave Asprey][dave-podcast]. I actually remember quite a few pieces of the advice from that show because I truly think it was good. 

- If you start a business, do it in something you are passionate about, not simply something which you technically competent in. Technical competence will not inspire the passion that gets you through the many late nights it takes to build a company.

- If your "why" is big enough, you can pursue anything. The story  that he gave to illustrate this point was an example from an ultra-marathon, so naturally I remember. Sage was completing in the [Marathon Des Sables][wiki-marathon], a 7 day run through the Sahara desert. On the longest day, he got food poisoning and was about to be disqualified for missing the timing checkpoints. He was passed by a blind Korean man who was running to raise money for a cancer which had killed his brother. It was a powerful story. It made me think about why I do the things I do.

Sage is a great speaker, and if you want evidence of that, try listening to the part of the podcast where he talks about [his experience with the marathon][dave-podcast-marathon]. Being a student of Tony Robbins, a  more reputable motivational speaker, Sage clearly says a lot of right things. I personally feel that his bit on doing something for a *why* which is bigger than yourself is hugely important component of a long term goal.

Even in light of that fact that Sage may be a fraudster, I would relisten to that podcast.<small>..with my inner skeptic tuned in.</small>

## The Not So Positives

Over a few weeks I watched segments of an interview where he talks about the primary emotions which humans experience. Aptly named, the video is titled after those emotions, [Fear and Love][fear-and-love]. To be fair, I don't remember much about the video's content except that it was full of positivity, flattery comments by the interviewers, and some strange rhetoric about how humans are evolving into a new kind of consciousness. What was important to me when I was watching is that I focused on the positive energy. If you watch the video, you might get the feeling that Sage was uptight. Possibly because he was squinting into the glare of the sun room. Maybe he wasn't comfortable for other reasons.

At some point, I saw a [Register news article][register-sage] linked in the comments to one of these videos. The article explained how Sage had created an energy company in Dubai in 2013. The company bought thousands of servers from HP at discounted prices and then resold them at profit, breaking a "Grey Market" contract and landing the company in a legal dispute. 

The Register article also went into some of his former businesses (he is after all, a self-proclaimed serial-entrepreneur). His former businesses allegedly included companies which sold bogus supplements by using fear mongering advertising, and a service to promote male escorts. His most recently folded company, *Space Energy*, never produced a watt of power. From the news covering the event, it seems like Sage intended to use the *Space Energy* as a vehicle for fraud. As far as I can tell, there's no clear consensus on that last statement. However, given his past business practices, this doesn't seem far-fetched. 

I'm not going to accept the facts from that article as it is a tabloid internet publication. However, as I was searching for more information about Sage, one of the most articulate exposes I found was from his recent trial proceedings. They were articulate and accurate against how I have heard Sage in podcasts and videos. As the honorable Justice Jay recalls,

> He is an extremely charming, charismatic and polished individual.

> ...when the going got tougher *[his responses]* became rambling, imprecise and evasive. Mr Sage was too keen to provide me with the "evolving context" and the "back story". He laced his evidence with overly insistent claims to honesty and frankness.

He consistently claims honesty. I think this is important, remembering that Sage is a man of incredible self-belief, "He likens himself to Nelson Mandela." Also, use of science-y words like "evolving" litter his podcasts. They add a tone of scientific levity to his conversations.

One more piece of evidence before I wrap this up, and because I think Jay's commentary is great,

> To be fair to him, I would *not describe him as being intellectually sophisticated*...

I understood this fact whenever Sage would ramble about "evolving consciousness" or "primal states" in his interviews and podcasts. Phrases like this simply sound nice but don't mean anything without an intellectual framework around them. It's rhetoric.

## Final Take

So here's my take on Peter Sage. His enthusiasm is extremely convincing. I think that when you are extremely compelling, it's possible that you stand at the risk of persuading yourself of something that may not be true. Perhaps conjuring the feeling of honesty is enough to come off as honest, no matter what it is that you happen to be saying.

I haven't stopped the practice of listening positive influences each morning, but I have become more selective. Convincing or not, I want a baseline of honesty.

## February 19, 2018 Addendum

I recently received some email feedback on this article of shared experience of learning about Sage's trial. It forced me to go back through and carefully read what I had written about a year ago, and what I found was that I had been very harsh on the man. I don't think it's right for me to basically call Sage a liar when all I know about the man is information I got from free podcasts, a summary of trial proceedings and the tabloid-ish Register.

I also reflected on that I had gained real utility through having listened to some of Sage's talks, because there are real nuggets of truth in them. Take for example a Nietzsche quote which he introduced me to, "he who has a why can bear almost any how". That's a resounding truth, and I'm happy to say that I found value in listening to Sage share that knowledge.

Another though comes to mind as I read my own words, "You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye." (Matthew 7:5). What gives me the right to disparage someone I don't really even know from the internet? Have I examined myself thoroughly? Am I guilty of the crime I label upon others?

Before I speak out against Sage, I should remember that he has helped a lot of people, myself included. I do not know the full truth about Sage, and so I should not cast out unsubstantiated judgment. Apologies.
