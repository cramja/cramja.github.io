I heard something that I felt was worth repeating.

I am three steps away from the primary source of this information: hospice patients. A nurse working with people facing their imminent death compiled a list of the most common regrets expressed by her patients. They're very simple and can be summarized as "I regret being a cog in the machine".

It's funny that the natural course of life is to shape us into unhappy, overworked drones. And yet, day after day of putting off reflection, ignoring passions, all in the favor of the fulfillment of the expectation of others, leads to the decay of the spirit.

But regrets are a product of decay and what I find more useful is a process for refinement. [Paul Graham][todo] takes the five regrets and transforms them into an imperative: for those who will one day die, these are the commandments that thou shalt follow if you are to avoid the decay of the spirit.

1. Don't forget your dreams
2. Don't work too much
3. Say what you think
4. Cultivate friendships 
5. Be happy

Amen.
